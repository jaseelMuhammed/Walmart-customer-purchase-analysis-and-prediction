# 🛒 Walmart Customer sales Analysis & Prediction
This project analyzes customer behavior data from Walmart to identify repeat customers using machine learning techniques and visualizes insights using Power BI. The goal is to help Walmart better understand loyal customer traits and drive data-informed marketing strategies.

### 📊 Project Overview
Objective:
Predict which customers are likely to return to Walmart stores and analyze behavioral and demographic patterns using:

- 🧠 Machine Learning (classification models)

- 📈 Power BI Dashboards

- 🧹 Data cleaning & EDA

- 📁 Files in the Repository

## File	Description

🔍 Key Steps
## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Handled missing values

- Encoded categorical variables

- Normalized numerical features

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Customer distribution by age, income, and product category

- Purchase frequency patterns

- Loyalty trends over time

## Feature Engineering

- Derived features like average spend, recency, frequency

- Used RFM-like scoring for behavioral segmentation

## Modeling

- Trained classification models (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

- Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## Dashboard Visualization

- Created dynamic filters for customer segments

- Visualized repeat customer trends, top product categories, and regional behaviors
  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook

- Power BI

- Git for version control


## 📌 Results & Insights
- Successfully classified repeat vs. one-time customers with high accuracy

- Identified key features influencing customer loyalty (e.g., spending pattern, age group)

- Power BI dashboard enables dynamic exploration of customer behavior
